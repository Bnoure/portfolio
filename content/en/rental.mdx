### Introduction

Rental was born from the need to create a practical and effective solution for car rentals, fulfilling a diploma exercise for full stack developers. Designed in just 24 hours, this platform enables easy vehicle search by city, model, and brand, providing a rapid response to urban mobility needs.

### Project Objectives

The main goal of Rental was to develop an intuitive interface that allows users to easily rent cars. The challenge of accomplishing this in 24 hours added a dimension of speed and efficiency to the mission, while incorporating essential features for an optimal user experience.

### Technologies Used

- **Ruby on Rails:** For backend management and business logic.
- **JavaScript:** To enhance the user interface dynamism.
- **Bootstrap:** For design and layout.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database to store user and reservation data.

### Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was the 24-hour time constraint imposed for development, which demanded high efficiency and strict prioritization of features. Additionally, integrating advanced options such as photo uploads for listing a car was complex but essential. To overcome these challenges, I adopted a modular approach, allowing for rapid feature additions without compromising the overall quality of the application.

### Configuration and Structure of the Project

Rental is structured to facilitate easy navigation and use. Users can create accounts, search for vehicles, and book directly on the platform. The interface is simple yet comprehensive, with clear functionalities for managing reservations and viewing vehicle details.

### Code Snippet: Seed Script

```ruby title="seed.rb"
# This script dynamically populates the database with cars and reservations
CITIES.each do |city|
  selected_brands.each do |brand|
    selected_models.each do |model|
      car = Car.new({
        brand: brand,
        model: model,
        year_of_production: Faker::Vehicle.year,
        address: "#{Faker::Address.street_address}, #{city}",
        city: city,
        price_per_day: rand(50..350)
      })
      user = users.sample
      car.user = user
      if ENV["CLOUDINARY_URL"]
        file = URI.open(IMAGES_URL.shuffle.pop)
        car.photo.attach(io: file, filename: "#{rand(1000)}.png", content_type: "image/png")
      end
      car.save!
      puts "Created #{car_counter} cars"
    end
  end
end
puts "----- End of car creation -----"

puts "----- Creating 25 reservations -----"
10.times do
  duration = rand(1..5).to_i
  car = Car.all.sample
  existing_bookings = car.bookings.order(:starts_at)
  start_date = Date.today
  existing_bookings.each do |booking|
    break unless start_date >= booking.starts_at && start_date < booking.ends_at
    start_date = booking.ends_at + 1
  end
  end_date = start_date + duration.days
  new_booking = Booking.new({
    car: car,
    starts_at: start_date,
    ends_at: end_date
  })
  new_booking.user = users.sample
  new_booking.save!
end
puts "----- End of reservation creation -----"
```

### Reflections

Developing Rental was an immensely rewarding experience, testing my rapid development skills and ability to integrate complex features in a very short time. This project not only affirmed my capabilities as a full stack developer but also highlighted the importance of planning and adaptability in software development.
