### Introduction

Koalapp is the result of a 24-hour challenge: to create a dynamic article distribution website. Leveraging an API call on NewsAPI and the integration of ChatGPT to reinvent titles and content, Koalapp offers an enriched and personalized reading experience of the latest news.

### Project Objectives

The primary goal of Koalapp was to provide an innovative reading experience by using artificial intelligence to customize articles. By implementing technologies such as Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, and APIs like NewsAPI & OpenAI, I developed a platform that offers enriching and interactive reading.

### Technologies Used

- **Ruby on Rails:** Utilized for backend management and business logic.
- **JavaScript:** Used for dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Bootstrap:** Employed for layout and styling.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database used for storing article and user data.
- **NewsAPI & OpenAI APIs:** Integrated for fetching the latest news and reprocessing articles.

### Project Configuration and Structure

Koalapp is configured to provide a smooth and intuitive reading experience. The homepage allows users to browse articles directly and leave comments. The integrated commenting feature encourages interaction and discussions around articles.

### Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge of Koalapp was the limited development time due to the 24-hour challenge. This required quick decision-making and a focus on essential features.

### Utilizing NewsAPI for Articles

NewsAPI is utilized to gather articles on tourism in French. Articles are filtered based on specific criteria such as topic, language, and relevance. Each article is then individually analyzed. If the title or content is empty, a GPT-3.5 model is used to generate a title and continue the article using the existing content as a base. This approach revitalizes articles and offers a more engaging reading experience.

```ruby title="seed.rb"
newsapi = News.new("XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX")
all_articles = newsapi.get_everything(q: 'tourisme',
                                      language: 'fr',
                                      sortBy: 'relevancy',
                                      excludeDomains: 'en.wikipedia.org')

all_articles.sample(25).each do |article|
  article.title = "Default Title" if article.title.blank?
  article.content = "Default Content" if article.content.blank?

  # Check if the title is empty and replace it with a value generated by GPT-3
  if article.title.blank?
    response_title = client.chat(
      parameters: {
        model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301",
        messages: [
          { role: "system", content: "You are a journalist." },
          { role: "user", content: "Content: #{article['content']}\n\nCreate a title for this article:" }
        ],
        temperature: 0.5,
        max_tokens: 60
      }
    )
    article.title = response_title['choices'].first['message']['content']
  end

  response = client.chat(
    parameters: {
      model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301",
      messages: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a journalist." },
        { role: "user", content: "Title: #{article.title}\nContent: #{article.content}\n\nContinue the article with exactly 2000 characters:" }
      ],
      temperature: 0.5,
      max_tokens: 800
    }
  )
  generated_text = response['choices'].first['message']['content']
```

### Reflections

Koalapp was a rewarding experience that allowed me to push the boundaries of web development within a constrained timeframe. This project not only allowed us to apply our technical skills but also explore new possibilities offered by artificial intelligence.
