### Introduction

This portfolio represents a personal challenge where I explored and mastered technologies such as React, TypeScript, Next.js, ContentLayer, and Prisma. It was designed not only to showcase my technical skills but also to serve as active learning through the implementation of these technologies.

### Project Objectives

The main objective of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to develop a complete web application while learning and structuring a project around specific technologies. This project also serves as a showcfase for my web development skills, highlighting my work and projects.

### Technologies Used

- **React & Next.js:** Chosen for their effectiveness in building modern and dynamic web applications.
- **TypeScript:** Used to enhance code security and maintainability through its type system.
- **ContentLayer:** Employed to efficiently and scalably organize site content.
- **Prisma:** Used to interact robustly and typographically with the database.
- **i18n:** Implemented to offer a multilingual experience, making the portfolio accessible to a broader audience.

### Project Configuration and Structure

The project is structured using a modular approach, where each component is designed to be reusable and maintainable.

### Key Features

- **Real-time language switching:** Allows users to switch between English and French, improving accessibility and engagement.
- **Simple and intuitive UI:** Designed to provide smooth navigation and frictionless interaction with the content.

### Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was adopting TypeScript for a full project, which required an in-depth understanding of advanced types and their implementations. This challenge was overcome through a combination of self-directed research and exchanges with the online community, allowing me to effectively integrate TypeScript into the project.

### Dynamic Route Management and Page Generation

I used Next.js's `getStaticPaths` and `getStaticProps` functions to manage dynamic routing and static page generation, key aspects for a high-performance and SEO-optimized site. These methods allowed me to pre-generate pages for each project at build time, ensuring ultra-fast load times and an enhanced user experience. Here is an excerpt of the code I used:

```tsx title="[slug].tsx"
export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const locales = ['en', 'fr']
  let paths = []
  for each locale of locales {
    const localeProjects = allProjects.filter(project =>
    project._raw.sourceFileDir === locale)
    const localePaths = localeProjects.map(project => ({
      params: { slug: project.slug },
      locale,
    }))
    paths = paths.concat(localePaths)
  }
  return { paths, fallback: 'blocking' }
}
export const getStaticProps = async ({ locale, params }) => {
	const project = allProjects.find(
		(p) => p.slug === params.slug && p._raw.sourceFileDir === locale
	)
	if (!project) {
		return { notFound: true }
	}
	return {
		props: {
			...(await serverSideTranslations(locale, ['common'])),
			project,
		},
	}
}
```

### Reflections

This project allowed me to gain a deep understanding of modern frontend technologies. I learned to internationalize an application, effectively use React hooks, and manage dynamic routes.
