### Introduction

This portfolio represents a personal challenge where I explored and mastered technologies such as React, TypeScript, Next.js, ContentLayer, and Prisma. It was designed not only to showcase my technical skills but also to serve as active learning through the implementation of these technologies.

### Project Objectives

The main objective of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to develop a complete web application while learning and structuring a project around specific technologies. This project also serves as a showcase for my web development skills, highlighting my work and projects.

### Technologies Used

- **React & Next.js:** Chosen for their effectiveness in building modern and dynamic web applications.
- **TypeScript:** Used to enhance code security and maintainability through its typing system.
- **ContentLayer:** Employed to efficiently and scalably organize site content.
- **Prisma:** Used for robust and typed interaction with the database.
- **i18n:** Implemented to provide a multilingual experience, making the portfolio accessible to a broader audience.

### Configuration and Structure of the Project

The project is structured using a modular approach, where each component is designed to be reusable and maintainable. The folder structure follows a logical organization that clearly separates business logic from UI presentation, thus facilitating testing and updates.

### Key Features

- **Real-time language switching:** Allows users to switch between English and French, improving accessibility and engagement.
- **Simple and intuitive UI:** Designed to provide smooth navigation and frictionless interaction with the content.

### Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge was adopting TypeScript for a complete project, which required a deep understanding of advanced types and their implementations. This challenge was met through a combination of self-directed research and exchanges with the online community, allowing me to overcome obstacles and effectively integrate TypeScript into the project.

### Installation and Configuration

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A package manager such as npm or yarn.

**Steps for local installation and execution:**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bnoure/portfolio.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Reflections

This project has allowed me to gain a deep understanding of modern frontend technologies and project management in a real environment. I have learned to internationalize an application, effectively use React hooks, and manage dynamic routes, essential skills for my future projects and professional opportunities.
