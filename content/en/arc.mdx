### Introduction

The "Arc" project was developed as part of a 24-hour challenge. The goal was to create a platform that allows users to search for and book hotel rooms based on city and date of stay. This project implements technologies such as Rails, JavaScript, Stimulus, Bootstrap, flatpickr, and Swal.

### Project Objectives

The main objective of this project was to demonstrate my mastery of web development within a limited timeframe. By implementing a functional solution for hotel room search and booking, I was able to put my skills in JS, Rails.

### Technologies Used

- **Ruby on Rails:** Utilized for the backend and database interaction.
- **JavaScript & Stimulus:** Used to make the user interface interactive and dynamic.
- **Bootstrap:** Used for layout and styling of the application.
- **flatpickr:** Integrated for selecting stay dates.
- **Swal:** Used to display user-friendly alert and confirmation messages.

### Project Configuration and Structure

The project is configured to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience. The search and booking functionalities are easily accessible from the main application interface.

### Challenges and Solutions

The main challenge of this project was to meet the 24-hour deadline while ensuring code quality and application functionality. By focusing my efforts on essential features and using predefined tools and libraries, I was able to successfully meet this challenge.

### Dynamic Search Parameter Handling

In this code, I used the **params** method to retrieve search parameters specified by the user. Based on these parameters, I executed an SQL query to retrieve corresponding hotels from the database. This approach optimizes performance by fetching only the necessary data for display, ensuring a responsive and enjoyable user experience.

```ruby title="hotel_controller.rb"
def index
  if params[:search] && params[:search][:city].present?
    @search_params = search_params.to_h
    @search_params[:start_date], @search_params[:end_date] = @search_params[:start_date].split(' au ')
    @hotels = Hotel.joins(:rooms).where(city: @search_params[:city]).where('rooms.capacity >= ?', @search_params[:capacity]).distinct
  else
    @hotels = Hotel.all
  end
end
```

### Reflections

This project allowed me to put my web development skills into practice in a constrained environment. I learned to work effectively under pressure while maintaining code quality and application functionality. It also allowed me to discover new tools and libraries to enhance my technical skills.
