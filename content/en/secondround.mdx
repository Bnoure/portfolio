### About the Project

SecondRound is a mobile web app designed to transform the buying and selling experience of pre-owned video games. This project was created during an intense 10-day challenge in collaboration with two other Full Stack developers. Together, we covered every aspect of development, from visual design to production, aiming to simplify and enrich interactions between video game store owners and players.

### Features for Sellers

- **Auto-generation of product sheets:** Photograph games and automatically obtain detailed product sheets ready for sale.
- **Reservation management:** View and easily accept ongoing reservations directly from the homepage.
- **Stock and modifications:** A dedicated space to manage stock and update video game sheets.

### Features for Players

- **Simplified search:** Find pre-owned video games near you thanks to search and auto-localization features.
- **Route and timer:** View the route to retrieve your game and follow the retrieval timer on the homepage.

### Technologies Used

- **Ruby on Rails:** Used for backend management and business logic.
- **JavaScript:** Used to make the user interface dynamic and interactive.
- **Bootstrap:** Used for layout and styling.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database used to store user and product data.
- **Redis:** Used to cache information taken via the user's camera.
- **GiantBomb & OpenAI APIs:** Integrated to retrieve game jackets and send them to ChatGPT for product sheet generation.

### Job Logic

The main logic of the application is encapsulated in `GetGameInfosJob`, a scheduled job that processes video game data from photos taken by users. This job uses `GetGameInfos`, a service to extract information via an external API and update the game data accordingly. Then, `AttachGamePicture` is called if the game's English title is present, adding a picture to the game sheet. Finally, the result is broadcast in real time via `ActionCable` to update the user on the status of the processing.

```ruby title="get_game_infos_job.rb"
class GetGameInfosJob < ApplicationJob
  queue_as :default
  retry_on ArgumentError, wait: 5.seconds, attempts: 1

  def perform(game, game_user_photo, game_uuid)
    game_infos_service = GetGameInfos.new(game_user_photo: game_user_photo)
    game_infos = game_infos_service.call
    game.update_with_api_data(game_infos)
    AttachGamePicture.new(game: game).call if game.english_title.present?
    ActionCable.server.broadcast("get_game_infos_channel_#{game_uuid}", { gameId: game.id })
  end
end
```

### Reflections

SecondRound was a challenging and educational experience, offering deep dives into the mechanics of web and mobile development under time constraints. This project not only improved our technical skills but also allowed us to test new approaches to enhance user interaction in the pre-owned video game commerce sector.
